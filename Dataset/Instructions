Dataset Instructions
The dataset consists of high-resolution traffic signal data along two arterial corridors on the Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. These are:
 - Corridor 1, named 300 W (US-89) consists of 10 signalized intersections
 - Corridor 2, named 700 E consists of 12 signalized intersections.
Data is provided on a intersection level at a frequency of of 0.1 second for the entire year of 2018 with some missing data.
The header of the files is: Signal ID, Datetime, Event Code, Event Parameter.
Each folder consists of the data for each intersection. The folders are named according to Signal ID.
Each file inside the folder is named as <month-number>_<signalid>. For example 11_7342 represents November data for the Signal ID 7342.
The details of the metadata can be found in the All Important tables.xlsx file attached at the top
The coding of the event codes and event parameters can be found at the following link: https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/jtrpdata/3/
The NEMA phasing scheme for each of the intersection can be found in the following link:https://udottraffic.utah.gov/ATSPM/Images/NEMA%20Phase%20%23%20Convention%20UDOT.pdf
The locations of the intersections can also be found alongwith the dataset provided.

Detailed information about detectors: 
See the attachment "ATSPM Detection Suggestions". go to page 2. page 2 shows a typical layout of UDOT detection and how it is generally set up. 
For example, if the Detection Hardware says (in "REPORTS" then "CONFIGURATION"): 
* Advance Count Advanced Speed: it is a 10 foot detection zone with the upper end located at the distance specified in the setup (Dist. From Stop Bar).
* Stop Bar Presence: This is generally a 65 foot zone that is located just a foot or two in front of the stop bar and extends back approximately 65 feet. 
* Lane-by-lane Count: this is generally a very small zone (about 3 feet wide) that is located at the stop bar. It may be within a few feet of the stop bar on either side but most of the time, it is pretty much at the stop bar.
* Lane-by-lane with Speed Restriction: this detection zone is the same size as the lane-by-lane count and is usually located at exactly the same location as the lane-by-lane count zone.

In order to detect the lane ID number of the detectors, go to the ATSPM website at: https://udottraffic.utah.gov/atspm. 
Then, go to: REPORTS - then CONFIGURATION. 
Then, type in the signal id number you're looking for or select it from the map. 
Scroll down until you see "Detectors". 
The 2nd column will show the detector channel and the other columns will provide details on the movement, detector type, phase, etc.
